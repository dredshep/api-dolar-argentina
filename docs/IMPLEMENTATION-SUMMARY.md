# Implementation Summary

## Problem
The original DolarSi API (`https://www.dolarsi.com/api/dolarSiInfo.xml`) used by this application is no longer available, causing all endpoints to return 500 errors.

## Solution
We've updated the `dolarSiService.js` file to use [DolarAPI.com](https://dolarapi.com/) as the new data source, but with limited functionality due to the differences between the APIs.

## Supported Endpoints

The following endpoints are fully supported with real data from DolarAPI.com:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/dolaroficial` | Official dollar rate |
| `/api/dolarblue` | Blue dollar rate |
| `/api/dolarbolsa` | Stock market dollar rate |
| `/api/dolarturista` | Tourist dollar rate |
| `/api/mayorista` | Wholesale dollar rate |
| `/api/all` | All available rates (limited to supported types) |

## Unsupported Endpoints

The following endpoints are **not supported** and will return a 500 error:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/contadoliqui` | Liquidity dollar rate |
| `/api/dolarpromedio` | Average dollar rate |
| `/api/riesgopais` | Country risk |
| Bank-specific endpoints | All bank-specific dollar rates |
| Exchange house endpoints | All exchange house rates |
| Euro and Real endpoints | All Euro and Real exchange rates |
| Evolution endpoints | All historical evolution data |
| BCRA endpoints | All BCRA reserves and circulation data |

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Data Source**:
   - Replaced the unavailable DolarSi API with DolarAPI.com
   - Endpoint: `https://dolarapi.com/v1/dolares`

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Created methods to transform the DolarAPI.com response to match the expected structure
   - Mapped DolarAPI keys to the original DolarSi keys
   - Added special casa mappings (casa380, casa344, etc.) required by the controllers

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling to throw proper errors for unsupported endpoints
   - Added detailed error logging

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md to clearly indicate which endpoints are supported and which aren't
   - Created API-COMPARISON.md to document the available API alternatives and limitations
   - Created this implementation summary

## Testing

We've thoroughly tested the updated service:

1. **API Source Testing**:
   - Created `test-api-sources.js` to test various API sources
   - Confirmed that DolarAPI.com is working and provides the necessary data
   - Confirmed that the original DolarSi API is indeed unavailable

2. **Endpoint Testing**:
   - Created `test-supported-endpoints.js` to test the supported endpoints
   - Verified that supported endpoints work correctly
   - Verified that unsupported endpoints fail with appropriate error messages

## Limitations and Future Work

The current implementation has significant limitations due to the differences between the original DolarSi API and DolarAPI.com. To support more endpoints, additional data sources would be needed.

Potential future improvements:
1. Integrate additional API sources for specific data types
2. Implement web scraping for data not available via APIs
3. Create a proxy API that combines data from multiple sources
